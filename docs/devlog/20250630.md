## What's Fixed

### Time Block Logic Simplification
- **Fixed incorrect time block calculation** where `9:46am` with `-b 10am` was showing `"6am - 11am"` instead of the expected `"10am - 3pm"`
- **Removed complex yesterday/today reference logic** that was causing confusion and edge cases
- **Eliminated "too early" error handling** - the system now always returns a valid block (either current or upcoming)
- **Fixed static block behavior** - blocks now automatically advance as time progresses without requiring restart

## What's New

### Automatic Block Advancement
- **Added `NextBlock(now)` method** to Block entity for seamless time progression
- **Integrated automatic block updates** in TUI refresh cycle - blocks now advance automatically every 5 hours
- **Simplified Block entity design** using concrete `startAt` timestamp instead of `startHour + timezone` pattern

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Always-valid blocks** - no more error messages when using block tracking at any time
- **Real-time block progression** - the displayed block automatically updates as 5-hour periods pass
- **Predictable 5-hour sliding windows** based on user's specified start time

### Auto-Width Table Columns
- **Dynamic column sizing** - table columns now automatically adjust to terminal width
- **Intelligent space distribution** - Model column gets 50% of extra space for long model names
- **Responsive compact mode** - narrow terminals combine Cache/Total columns for better fit
- **No model name truncation** - full model names display when space allows

## Design Decisions

### Value Object Pattern for Block Entity
- **Concrete timestamps over calculated references** - Block now stores `startAt time.Time` directly
- **Immutable block progression** - `NextBlock()` returns new Block instances rather than modifying existing ones
- **Encapsulated time calculations** - all block logic contained within the Block entity

### Simplified Time Logic
- **Delta-based calculations** - determine current block by calculating time difference from user's start hour
- **Automatic yesterday/today handling** - when current time is before start hour but within reasonable range (12+ hours), automatically use previous day's reference
- **Removed error states** - always show either current active block or next upcoming block

### Testing Strategy
- **Focused on core scenarios** - removed complex edge case tests that were testing implementation details rather than business logic
- **Added NextBlock method tests** - comprehensive coverage of automatic block advancement behavior
- **Maintained test coverage** at 57.9% for entity layer

### Auto-Width Table Design
- **Similar to Usage Statistics** - follows same pattern as existing auto-width stats section
- **Proportional space distribution** - Model column prioritized with 50% of extra space
- **Overhead accounting** - considers borders and padding in width calculations
- **Responsive breakpoints** - compact mode activated below 80 character width

## Impact

### Time Block Improvements
This refactoring addresses the primary user complaint about confusing time block behavior and provides a much more intuitive experience. The automatic advancement feature ensures users always see accurate, up-to-date block information without manual intervention.

### Table Display Enhancement
The auto-width table columns significantly improve readability of long Claude model names across different terminal sizes. Users can now see full model names without truncation on medium and wide terminals, while narrow terminals get a compact but still readable layout. This matches the professional look and feel of the Usage Statistics section.
