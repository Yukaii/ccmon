# ccmon Configuration File Example
# 
# This is an example configuration file for ccmon.
# Copy this file to one of the following locations:
#   - ./config.toml (current directory - highest priority)
#   - ~/.ccmon/config.toml (user config directory)
#
# You can use .toml, .yaml, or .json formats.
# 
# The application searches for configuration files in order:
# 1. Current directory (./config.{toml,yaml,json})
# 2. User config directory (~/.ccmon/config.{toml,yaml,json})
# 
# The first configuration file found will be used.
# If no configuration file is found, default values will be used.
