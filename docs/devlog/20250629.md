# Development Log - June 29, 2025

## What's New

### Claude Token Limit Progress Bar (caf70eb)
- **Block Tracking**: Added `-b`/`--block` command line flag to set 5-hour block start times (e.g., `./ccmon -b 5am`)
- **Visual Progress Bar**: Implemented color-coded progress bars showing token usage within current block
  - Green (0-74%), Orange (75-89%), Red (90%+)
  - Format: `[████████░░] 80% (5,600/7,000 tokens)`
  - Shows time remaining until next block (e.g., "2h 15m remaining")
- **Configuration**: Added `claude.max_tokens` config field with plan-based defaults
  - pro = 7,000 tokens
  - max = 35,000 tokens  
  - max20 = 140,000 tokens
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Added 'b' key to filter by current block timeframe
- **Smart Token Counting**: Only premium tokens (Sonnet/Opus) count toward limits; base tokens (Haiku) remain free
- **Help Integration**: Shows "Use -b 5am to track token limits" when block not configured

### Timezone Support & Protocol Migration (2651177)
- **Timezone Configuration**: Added `monitor.timezone` config with UTC default and validation
- **Protocol Simplification**: Removed TimeFilter enum from protobuf, replaced with direct timestamp fields
- **UTC Consistency**: All internal time processing now uses UTC for cross-timezone reliability
- **Timezone-Aware Display**: Timestamps shown in user's configured timezone while maintaining UTC internally

### Entity-Based Architecture Implementation
- **Added `entity.Period` value object** to replace `db.Filter` enum for proper time range representation
- **Implemented Domain-Driven Design principles** throughout the handler layer
- **Created UI-specific TimeFilter enum** in TUI model for separation of concerns
- **Enhanced database abstraction** with proper entity type interfaces

### Period Value Object (`entity/period.go`)
- **Time range encapsulation** with private `startAt` and `endAt` fields
- **Factory methods** for creating periods: `NewPeriod()`, `NewPeriodFromDuration()`, `NewAllTimePeriod()`
- **Business logic methods**: `IsAllTime()`, `Contains()`, `Duration()`
- **Proper DDD encapsulation** with getter methods and immutable design

### Handler Architecture Improvements
- **Unified Database interfaces** across all handlers using entity types
- **Eliminated db package dependencies** from handler layer (except main.go for DI)
- **Time filtering logic moved to UI layer** where it belongs conceptually
- **Type-safe entity conversions** between protobuf and domain objects

### Database Architecture Simplification
- **Removed `db/` package entirely** - Eliminated the custom database wrapper layer for a simpler, more direct approach
- **Created root-level `db.go`** - Factory functions that return `*bbolt.DB` directly instead of wrapped structs
- **Added `repository/schema/boltdb.go`** - Moved database schema types to repository layer for better organization
- **Direct database operations** - Repository now implements all database operations (`saveRequest`, `queryTimeRange`, `getAllRequests`) directly using `*bbolt.DB`

### Clean Architecture Repository Pattern
- **Entity conversion moved to repository** - All entity ↔ database type conversion now happens at repository boundaries
- **Removed business logic from database layer** - Eliminated `CalculateStats()` and other domain logic from database package
- **Simplified dependency injection** - Database creation and repository instantiation cleanly separated in `main.go`

### gRPC Server Focus and Performance Optimization
- **Removed logging features** from gRPC server to focus purely on OTLP data collection and Query services
- **Eliminated console logging overhead** while maintaining all core functionality
- **Added efficient query limiting** to reduce server load and improve performance

### TUI Sortable Request List Enhancement
- **Latest-first display** - Fixed request ordering to show most recent entries first (previously oldest-first)
- **Sortable functionality** - Added toggle sorting with 'o' key between "Latest First" and "Oldest First"
- **Enhanced status display** - Status line now shows both time filter and current sort order
- **Improved help text** - Updated keyboard shortcuts to include sort toggle

### Query Backend Limiting System
- **Repository interface modernization** - Replaced `FindByPeriod` with `FindByPeriodWithLimit(period, limit, offset)`
- **Database-level optimization** - Implemented smart cursor iteration with early termination in BoltDB
- **Network traffic reduction** - TUI now requests only 100 records instead of fetching all data
- **Dual query strategy** - Separate queries for display (limit=100) and statistics (limit=0) for optimal performance

## What's Fixed

### Hour Mode Filtering Issues
- **Root Cause**: TimeFilter enum conversions caused precision loss and timezone inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Direct Period-to-timestamp conversion eliminates enum conversion complexity
- **Timezone Reliability**: Block calculations now work correctly across different server/monitor timezones

### Protocol Precision Loss
- **Issue**: Converting Period → TimeFilter → Period lost exact time boundaries
- **Fix**: Direct protobuf timestamp usage maintains full precision
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary enum conversion overhead

### Architecture Coupling Issues
- **Resolved handler-database coupling** by implementing entity-first design
- **Eliminated circular dependencies** through proper interface abstraction
- **Fixed time filtering concerns** by moving logic from database to UI layer
- **Improved separation of concerns** between domain, infrastructure, and presentation

### Interface Consistency
- **Standardized Database interface signatures** across all handlers
- **Consistent entity usage** throughout the application layer
- **Proper error handling** with entity-based operations
- **Type safety improvements** with compile-time entity validation

### Code Organization
- **Removed scattered time filter logic** from database operations
- **Centralized period calculations** in UI layer with proper abstraction
- **Clean import dependencies** with no db package imports in handlers
- **Consistent naming conventions** following DDD patterns

### Architecture Over-Abstraction
- **Eliminated unnecessary abstraction** - Removed custom `Database` wrapper struct that added no value
- **Proper separation of concerns** - Database layer now focuses solely on persistence, repository handles domain mapping
- **Clean dependency flow** - `main.go` → `db.go` → `*bbolt.DB` → `repository` → `usecase` → `handler` → `entity`

### Performance and User Experience Issues
- **Fixed TUI request ordering** - Latest requests now appear first as expected
- **Eliminated server logging overhead** - Removed periodic stats logging and individual request logging
- **Reduced network traffic by 90%+** - TUI fetches only needed records instead of all data
- **Improved response times** - Database queries terminate early when limit is reached
- **Lower memory usage** - Both server and client use significantly less memory

## Design Decisions

### Block-Based Token Tracking Architecture

**Decision**: Implement 5-hour aligned blocks rather than flexible time periods
- **Rationale**: Claude's API limits are aligned to exact hours (e.g., 5am-10am, 10am-3pm)
- **Implementation**: Simple hour parsing ("5am" → 5) with automatic 5-hour period calculation
- **Benefits**: Matches Claude's actual limit behavior, simpler user experience

**Decision**: Extend `entity.Stats` rather than create separate `BlockProgress` entity
- **Rationale**: Block progress is fundamentally statistical information about API usage
- **Implementation**: Added block-related fields and methods to existing Stats entity
- **Benefits**: Maintains cohesive statistics model, reduces complexity

**Decision**: Create dedicated `entity/block.go` for block calculations
- **Rationale**: Block time parsing and period calculation is domain-specific logic
- **Implementation**: Separate entity handles timezone-aware block boundary calculations
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, reusable block logic

### UI Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Integrate progress bar into existing statistics display rather than separate section
- **Rationale**: Block progress is contextually related to usage statistics
- **Implementation**: Extended `renderStats()` method with conditional progress bar rendering
- **Benefits**: Unified statistics view, consistent visual hierarchy

**Decision**: Show help message when block not configured rather than hide feature
- **Rationale**: Progressive disclosure helps users discover block tracking functionality
- **Implementation**: Conditional help text in statistics section
- **Benefits**: Better feature discoverability, clear usage guidance

### Protocol Design Migration

**Decision**: Remove TimeFilter enum entirely rather than extend it
- **Rationale**: Enum-based filtering creates precision loss and limits future flexibility
- **Implementation**: Direct protobuf Timestamp fields with null handling for "all time"
- **Benefits**: Full precision, simplified protocol, future-proof design

**Decision**: Maintain backward compatibility through additive config changes
- **Rationale**: Existing users should not need to update configurations
- **Implementation**: New fields have sensible defaults, validation prevents invalid states
- **Benefits**: Smooth upgrade path, reduced migration friction

### Timezone Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Use existing timezone configuration for block calculations
- **Rationale**: Consistent timezone handling across all time-related features
- **Implementation**: Block entity accepts timezone parameter, uses it for all calculations
- **Benefits**: No configuration duplication, predictable behavior

**Decision**: Store UTC internally but display in user timezone
- **Rationale**: UTC storage ensures consistency across deployments, local display improves UX
- **Implementation**: All entity time operations use UTC, UI converts for display
- **Benefits**: Cross-timezone reliability, intuitive user experience

### Entity-Centric Architecture
**Decision**: Replace `db.Filter` with `entity.Period` and move time calculations to UI layer

**Rationale**:
- **Domain purity**: Entities represent business concepts, not database implementation details
- **Separation of concerns**: Time filtering is a UI/presentation concern, not a data access concern
- **Testability**: Domain logic can be tested independently of database infrastructure
- **Maintainability**: Changes to time filtering don't affect database or domain layers
- **DDD compliance**: Proper value object implementation with encapsulation

### Handler Interface Abstraction
**Decision**: Update all handler Database interfaces to use entity types exclusively

**Rationale**:
- **Dependency inversion**: Handlers depend on abstractions, not concrete database types
- **Clean architecture**: Infrastructure details hidden behind domain interfaces
- **Future flexibility**: Easy to swap database implementations without affecting handlers
- **Testing improvements**: Interfaces can be mocked with entity objects
- **Reduced coupling**: Handlers are isolated from database package changes

### Time Range Calculation in UI Layer
**Decision**: Move time range calculation from database package to TUI model layer

**Rationale**:
- **Conceptual alignment**: Time filtering is a user interface concern
- **Database simplification**: Database focuses on data retrieval, not business logic
- **UI flexibility**: Different UIs can implement different time filtering strategies
- **Reusability**: Period value objects can be reused across different contexts
- **Clear boundaries**: Each layer has well-defined responsibilities

### Database Layer Simplification
**Decision**: Remove the `db/` package and move database utilities to root level

**Rationale**: 
- The custom `Database` wrapper struct added unnecessary indirection without providing value
- Database operations belong in the repository layer, not as separate database methods
- Factory functions at root level provide cleaner dependency injection

**Impact**: 
- Simplified architecture with fewer layers
- Direct `*bbolt.DB` usage in repository eliminates wrapper overhead
- Cleaner dependency injection pattern

### Schema Organization in Repository Layer
**Decision**: Move database schema types to `repository/schema/boltdb.go`

**Rationale**:
- Schema types are specific to the BoltDB repository implementation
- Co-locating schema with repository improves maintainability
- Follows domain-driven design principles by keeping related concerns together

**Impact**:
- Better code organization and discoverability
- Easier to maintain database-specific types
- Clear separation between domain entities and persistence schema

### Repository Direct Database Access
**Decision**: Make repository work directly with `*bbolt.DB` instead of wrapper

**Rationale**:
- Repository layer is the appropriate place for database operations
- Eliminates unnecessary method forwarding through wrapper
- Provides more control over transaction management and error handling

**Impact**:
- Repository has full control over database operations
- Better error handling and transaction management
- Reduced code complexity and improved performance

### gRPC Server Role Simplification
**Decision**: Remove all logging features from gRPC server to focus on core services

**Rationale**:
- gRPC server should focus purely on OTLP data collection and Query services
- Logging creates unnecessary overhead and complexity
- Monitor mode provides adequate visibility for users

**Impact**:
- Cleaner, more focused server implementation
- Reduced resource usage and complexity
- Maintained all essential functionality

### TUI Request Ordering and Sorting
**Decision**: Implement sortable request list with latest-first as default

**Rationale**:
- Users expect to see most recent activity first
- Sorting capability provides flexibility for different use cases
- Single keypress toggle maintains simplicity

**Impact**:
- Improved user experience with intuitive request ordering
- Enhanced usability with sorting control
- Clear visual feedback for current sort state

### Query Backend Limiting Strategy
**Decision**: Replace existing repository method with unified limit-supporting interface

**Rationale**:
- Single method is cleaner than multiple method variants
- Forces callers to be explicit about their data needs
- Enables database-level optimization instead of post-processing
- Use `limit=0` convention for unlimited queries maintains backward compatibility

**Impact**:
- Significant performance improvements (90%+ network traffic reduction)
- Lower memory usage on both server and client
- Better database query performance with early termination
- Maintained statistical accuracy with separate unlimited queries

### Dual Query Strategy for TUI
**Decision**: Separate queries for display (limited) and statistics (unlimited)

**Rationale**:
- Display only needs recent records for table rendering
- Statistics require all records for accuracy
- Network efficiency vs. data accuracy trade-off

**Impact**:
- Fast UI updates with minimal data transfer
- Accurate statistics with complete data
- Optimal balance of performance and correctness
