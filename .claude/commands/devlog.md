Update the devlog for today, including the following:

- What's new
- What's fixed
- Design decisions

The devlog should be written in Markdown format and saved in the `docs/devlog/[YYYYMMDD].md` file, where `[YYYYMMDD]` is today's date in the format `YYYYMMDD`.

You can use `git log` to check the recent commits to work on this file.
