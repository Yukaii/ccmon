# Development Log - June 30, 2025

## What's Fixed

### Time Block Logic Simplification
- **Fixed incorrect time block calculation** where `9:46am` with `-b 10am` was showing `"6am - 11am"` instead of the expected `"10am - 3pm"`
- **Removed complex yesterday/today reference logic** that was causing confusion and edge cases
- **Eliminated "too early" error handling** - the system now always returns a valid block (either current or upcoming)
- **Fixed static block behavior** - blocks now automatically advance as time progresses without requiring restart

## What's New

### Automatic Block Advancement
- **Added `NextBlock(now)` method** to Block entity for seamless time progression
- **Integrated automatic block updates** in TUI refresh cycle - blocks now advance automatically every 5 hours
- **Simplified Block entity design** using concrete `startAt` timestamp instead of `startHour + timezone` pattern

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Always-valid blocks** - no more error messages when using block tracking at any time
- **Real-time block progression** - the displayed block automatically updates as 5-hour periods pass
- **Predictable 5-hour sliding windows** based on user's specified start time

### Auto-Width Table Columns
- **Dynamic column sizing** - table columns now automatically adjust to terminal width
- **Intelligent space distribution** - Model column gets 50% of extra space for long model names
- **Responsive compact mode** - narrow terminals combine Cache/Total columns for better fit
- **No model name truncation** - full model names display when space allows

## Design Decisions

### Value Object Pattern for Block Entity
- **Concrete timestamps over calculated references** - Block now stores `startAt time.Time` directly
- **Immutable block progression** - `NextBlock()` returns new Block instances rather than modifying existing ones
- **Encapsulated time calculations** - all block logic contained within the Block entity

### Simplified Time Logic
- **Delta-based calculations** - determine current block by calculating time difference from user's start hour
- **Automatic yesterday/today handling** - when current time is before start hour but within reasonable range (12+ hours), automatically use previous day's reference
- **Removed error states** - always show either current active block or next upcoming block

### Testing Strategy
- **Focused on core scenarios** - removed complex edge case tests that were testing implementation details rather than business logic
- **Added NextBlock method tests** - comprehensive coverage of automatic block advancement behavior
- **Maintained test coverage** at 57.9% for entity layer

### Auto-Width Table Design
- **Similar to Usage Statistics** - follows same pattern as existing auto-width stats section
- **Proportional space distribution** - Model column prioritized with 50% of extra space
- **Overhead accounting** - considers borders and padding in width calculations
- **Responsive breakpoints** - compact mode activated below 80 character width

### Model Validation & Resilience
- **Added `NewModel` constructor** with validation for creating Model entities
- **Implemented resilient fallback behavior** - invalid model names now default to "unknown" instead of causing errors
- **Enhanced telemetry reliability** - ensures API request creation never fails due to unexpected model names from Claude Code
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - added `entity/model_test.go` with table-driven tests for all validation scenarios

### Code Cleanup & Architecture
- **Removed unused `TimeFilter` types** from repository schema package
- **Eliminated dead code** - cleaned up obsolete filtering logic in favor of `entity.Period`
- **Clarified architecture boundaries** - time filtering now exclusively handled in presentation layer
- **Moved token limits** from Stats entity to Block entity for better separation of concerns

## Design Decisions

### Resilient Model Creation
- **Graceful degradation over strict validation** - chose to return "unknown" instead of errors for monitoring robustness
- **YAGNI principle applied** - avoided adding speculative methods like `IsPremium()` or `ModelFamily()`
- **Factory function pattern** - `NewModel()` centralizes validation logic and ensures consistent behavior

### Entity Responsibility Separation
- **Block-centric token limits** - moved `MaxTokens()` from Stats to Block entity where it logically belongs
- **Immutable value objects** - maintained DDD principles with private fields and getter methods
- **Clear entity boundaries** - Stats focuses on calculated metrics, Block handles time-based constraints

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- **Dead code elimination** - removed unused schema types that were duplicating TUI functionality
- **Architecture clarification** - filtering responsibility clearly assigned to presentation layer
- **Test-driven development** - comprehensive test coverage for new Model validation logic

## Impact

### Time Block Improvements
This refactoring addresses the primary user complaint about confusing time block behavior and provides a much more intuitive experience. The automatic advancement feature ensures users always see accurate, up-to-date block information without manual intervention.

### Table Display Enhancement
The auto-width table columns significantly improve readability of long Claude model names across different terminal sizes. Users can now see full model names without truncation on medium and wide terminals, while narrow terminals get a compact but still readable layout. This matches the professional look and feel of the Usage Statistics section.

### Telemetry Reliability
The resilient Model creation ensures that unexpected model names from Claude Code telemetry never cause data loss or application failures. The "unknown" fallback provides visibility into unrecognized models while maintaining system stability.

### Codebase Health
Cleanup of unused code and proper entity responsibility separation improves maintainability and reduces cognitive overhead for developers. The architecture now more clearly separates concerns between data persistence, business logic, and presentation layers.

## Latest Updates (Evening Session)

### What's Fixed
- **Period Entity Time Dependencies**: Removed system time dependencies from Period entity constructors
- **Model Length Validation**: Eliminated unnecessary 3-character minimum length requirement for model names
- **Timezone Complexity**: Simplified timezone handling by removing `NewPeriodFromDurationWithTimezone` function

### What's New
- **Pure Entity Design**: Period entity now follows clean architecture with dependency injection for time parameters
- **Simplified Period Creation**: UTC-only period creation with timezone handling moved to presentation layer

### Design Decisions

#### Period Entity Refactoring
- **From**: Entity with system dependencies calling `time.Now()` internally
- **To**: Pure entity accepting time parameters via constructor
- **Benefits**: Testable, no side effects, flexible time source control

#### Timezone Architecture Simplification
- **Decision**: Remove timezone complexity from entity layer
- **Implementation**: Timezone now only used for display formatting in UI
- **Impact**: Cleaner separation of concerns, simpler mental model

#### Model Validation Cleanup  
- **Removed**: Arbitrary 3-character minimum length constraint
- **Kept**: Empty/whitespace validation with "unknown" fallback
- **Rationale**: More flexible while maintaining data integrity

### Architecture Enhancement

The Period entity now exemplifies proper DDD patterns:

```go
// Clean Architecture - Accept dependencies via parameters
func NewPeriodFromDuration(now time.Time, duration time.Duration) Period

// Previous - System dependency embedded in entity  
func NewPeriodFromDuration(duration time.Duration) Period // Called time.Now()
```

This makes entities:
- **Pure**: No system dependencies or side effects
- **Testable**: Time can be injected for any test scenario  
- **Flexible**: Caller controls the time source

### Files Updated
- `entity/period.go` - Removed timezone complexity, simplified constructors
- `entity/model.go` - Removed minimum length validation  
- `handler/tui/view_model.go` - Updated to inject time parameters
- `handler/grpc/query/service.go` - Updated Period usage
- `repository/grpc_api_request_repository.go` - Updated Period usage  
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation and examples

## Latest Updates (Final Session)

### What's New

#### Block Logic Ownership Refactoring
- **Moved block logic to TUI handler**: Block time parsing and calculation logic moved from root package to `handler/tui` where it belongs
- **Improved dependency injection**: TUI handler now receives `MonitorConfig` struct containing all monitor-related configuration
- **Cleaner main.go**: Removed complex block calculation, timezone loading, and validation logic from main coordination layer

#### Enhanced Configuration Architecture
- **Single config parameter**: `RunMonitor` now accepts single `MonitorConfig` struct instead of multiple scattered parameters
- **Computed values in config**: Token limit computed in main.go and included in config struct
- **Self-contained handlers**: TUI handler has everything it needs internally

### What's Fixed

#### Entity Simplification
- **Simplified Block entity**: Removed `NewCurrentBlock` and `NewCurrentBlockWithLimit` factory functions from entity
- **Eliminated code duplication**: Removed redundant token limit calculation logic between packages
- **Cleaner imports**: Block entity now only imports `fmt` and `time` (removed `strconv` and `strings`)

#### Code Organization
- **Proper ownership boundaries**: Block logic now owned by the handler that uses it
- **No root package pollution**: Removed `block.go` and `block_test.go` from root directory
- **Better separation of concerns**: Main.go focuses on coordination, TUI handles its implementation

### Design Decisions

#### Clean Architecture Compliance
- **Handler ownership principle**: Logic moved to the component that actually uses it
- **Configuration over computation**: Pass config structs instead of computed values
- **Entity focus**: Block entity simplified to pure value object representing time periods

#### Dependency Injection Pattern
- **MonitorConfig struct**: Contains `Server`, `Timezone`, `RefreshInterval`, `TokenLimit`, `BlockTime`
- **Private functions**: Block logic functions now private within TUI package (`parseBlockTime`, `calculateCurrentBlock`)
- **No business logic duplication**: Single source of truth for token limit calculation

#### Test Coverage Maintenance
- **Moved tests with logic**: Block tests moved to `handler/tui` package with full coverage preserved
- **Private function testing**: Tests updated to use private functions within TUI package  
- **No functionality regression**: All existing features work exactly the same

### Architecture Impact

The refactoring improves the overall architecture by:
- **Clear ownership boundaries**: Each component owns its specific logic
- **Reduced coupling**: Main coordination layer decoupled from business logic implementation
- **Better maintainability**: Logic changes contained within owning component
- **Enhanced testability**: Self-contained components with focused responsibilities

### Files Updated (Final Session)
- `handler/tui/block.go` - Created with moved block logic (private functions)
- `handler/tui/block_test.go` - Created with comprehensive test coverage
- `handler/tui/program.go` - Added `MonitorConfig` struct and updated `RunMonitor` signature
- `entity/block.go` - Removed `ParseBlockTime`, `NewCurrentBlock`, `NewCurrentBlockWithLimit` functions
- `entity/block_test.go` - Removed tests for moved functionality
- `main.go` - Simplified to use single config parameter, removed complex logic

## Daily Usage Tab Feature (Latest Updates)

### What's New

#### Tab Navigation System
- **Added daily usage tab**: New tab accessible via Tab key showing last 30 days of usage statistics
- **Tab switching functionality**: Seamless navigation between "Current" and "Daily Usage" tabs
- **Enhanced TUI structure**: Extended view model to support multi-tab interface

#### Premium Token Breakdown
- **8-column detailed table**: Date, Requests (Base/Premium), Input, Output, Read Cache, Creation Cache, Total, Premium Cost
- **Premium token focus**: Only shows premium tokens (Sonnet/Opus) since base tokens are free
- **Granular insights**: Separate columns for each token type enabling cache usage optimization

#### Usage Entity Architecture
- **New Usage entity**: Contains `[]Stats` array for flexible time period support
- **Enhanced Stats entity**: Added `Period` field for temporal context
- **GetUsageQuery usecase**: Implements daily usage calculation using existing repository patterns

### What's Improved

#### User Experience Enhancements
- **Clear explanatory text**: Added subtitle and legend explaining premium token focus
- **Responsive design**: Compact mode for narrow terminals with essential information
- **Base/Premium split**: Request column shows "10/5" format for clear usage breakdown

#### Data Presentation
- **Premium cost visibility**: Focus on billable costs while excluding free base token usage
- **Cache optimization insights**: Detailed cache read/creation token breakdown for cost optimization
- **Proper formatting**: Consistent date format (2025-06-30) and token count formatting

### Design Decisions

#### Entity Architecture
- **Period-based statistics**: Each `Stats` includes temporal context via `Period` field
- **Repository reuse**: Used existing `APIRequestRepository` instead of creating separate `UsageRepository`
- **CQRS pattern compliance**: Implemented `GetUsageQuery` following established usecase patterns

#### UI/UX Design
- **Premium token emphasis**: Decided to show only premium tokens since base tokens don't impact billing
- **Explanatory text placement**: Added subtle help text to clarify data scope without interface clutter
- **Tab-based navigation**: Chosen for intuitive separation between current monitoring and historical analysis

#### Technical Implementation
- **8-column responsive layout**: Optimized column widths for standard terminal sizes with proper spacing
- **Compact mode breakpoint**: Activates at width < 60 characters for mobile/narrow terminal support
- **Entity-driven approach**: Extended existing entities rather than creating duplicate data structures

### Files Updated (Daily Usage Feature)
- `entity/usage.go` - New entity for holding period-based statistics
- `entity/usage_test.go` - Comprehensive test coverage for Usage entity
- `entity/stats.go` - Added Period field for temporal context
- `usecase/get_usage_query.go` - New usecase for daily usage calculation
- `usecase/get_usage_query_test.go` - Test coverage for usage query logic
- `handler/tui/view_model.go` - Added tab state management and usage data handling
- `handler/tui/renderer.go` - Enhanced with daily usage tab rendering and explanatory text
- `main.go` - Updated to create and inject GetUsageQuery for both server and monitor modes

### Impact

The daily usage tab feature provides comprehensive insights into premium token consumption patterns while maintaining clean, responsive TUI design. Users can now:
- Track daily usage trends over the last 30 days
- Identify cache utilization patterns for cost optimization
- Understand base vs premium request distribution
- Monitor premium costs that impact billing

This enhancement significantly improves the value proposition of ccmon for users managing Claude API costs and usage optimization.

## Fixed Daily Usage Timezone Handling

### Problem
The daily usage feature was not displaying dates based on the user's configured timezone. When a user in Tokyo (UTC+9) viewed their daily usage, requests made at 11:30 PM UTC would appear on the wrong day because the grouping was done in UTC rather than the user's timezone.

### Solution
Updated the `GetUsageQuery.ListByDay` method to accept a timezone parameter and calculate day boundaries in the user's timezone:

1. **Modified `usecase/get_usage_query.go`**:
   - Added `timezone *time.Location` parameter to `ListByDay` method
   - Calculate day boundaries using the provided timezone
   - Convert to UTC for database queries while maintaining timezone-aware boundaries

2. **Updated `handler/tui/view_model.go`**:
   - Pass `vm.timezone` when calling `ListByDay` in `recalculateUsage()`

3. **Fixed `handler/tui/renderer.go`**:
   - Updated `renderCompactDailyUsage` to accept timezone parameter
   - Convert UTC times back to user's timezone for display

4. **Added comprehensive tests**:
   - Test timezone handling with requests near midnight
   - Verify requests appear on correct days in different timezones
   - Test nil timezone defaults to UTC

### Implementation Details
- Day boundaries are calculated in the user's timezone (e.g., midnight to midnight in Tokyo time)
- These boundaries are converted to UTC for database queries
- When displaying dates, UTC times are converted back to the user's timezone
- This ensures consistent day grouping across the entire application

### Testing
Added `TestGetUsageQuery_ListByDay_Timezone` that verifies:
- A request at 11:30 PM UTC appears on the same day in UTC and New York (UTC-5)
- The same request appears on the next day in Tokyo (UTC+9)
- Nil timezone parameter defaults to UTC

All tests pass and the linter reports no issues.
