## What's New

#### Centralized Test Infrastructure with Factory Pattern

Introduced a comprehensive `testutil` package that centralizes all mock repository creation through factory methods. This new testing infrastructure provides:

- **Unified Mock Creation**: Factory methods like `NewMockRepositoryPair()`, `NewMockRepositoryWithData()`, and `NewMockPlanRepository()` create consistent mock instances across all test packages
- **Test Data Helpers**: Built-in functions like `CreateTestAPIRequestsSet()` and `CreateTestStats()` generate realistic test data for various scenarios
- **Performance Testing Support**: Instrumented repositories with call counting for cache integration tests and performance analysis
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Over 35 factory methods covering all repository interfaces and common testing scenarios

The factory approach enables developers to focus on test logic rather than mock setup, while ensuring consistency across the entire test suite.

#### Enhanced Repository Architecture

Completed the separation of concerns between `APIRequestRepository` and `StatsRepository` interfaces:

- **GRPCStatsRepository**: Optimized client-side statistics queries using gRPC `GetStats` method instead of fetching raw data
- **BoltDBStatsRepository**: Server-side statistics calculation from local database 
- **Clear Interface Boundaries**: APIRequestRepository handles data persistence, StatsRepository handles statistics aggregation

This separation resolves the gRPC message size limit issue that occurred with large datasets in non-UTC timezones while maintaining architectural clarity.

## What's Fixed

#### Test Infrastructure Overhaul

**Problem**: Tests across multiple packages contained duplicate mock repository implementations (over 400 lines of duplicated code), making maintenance difficult and error-prone.

**Root Cause**: Each test package was defining its own mock repositories with slightly different behaviors and interfaces, leading to inconsistencies and code duplication.

**Solution**: Implemented a centralized factory pattern that:
- Eliminates all duplicate mock implementations across 15+ test files
- Provides consistent mock behavior through standardized factory methods
- Maintains full test compatibility while reducing codebase size
- Improves test readability by removing mock setup boilerplate

**Impact**: Reduced test codebase by ~400 lines while adding comprehensive factory functionality, resulting in a net gain of maintainability and consistency.

#### Repository Interface Separation Issues

**Problem**: After implementing the StatsRepository interface separation, test compilation failures occurred due to mismatched repository types in test mocks.

**Root Cause**: Test mocks were still implementing APIRequestRepository patterns where StatsRepository interface was expected, causing type mismatches.

**Solution**: 
- Created proper mock wrappers that implement StatsRepository interface
- Updated all test packages to use appropriate repository mocks
- Maintained backwards compatibility while enforcing proper interface separation

**Impact**: All tests now pass with proper architectural boundaries maintained between data persistence and statistics calculation responsibilities.

## Design Decisions

#### Factory Pattern for Test Mocks

**Context**: Multiple test packages were duplicating mock repository implementations with slight variations, leading to maintenance overhead and inconsistency.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Keep existing duplicated mocks (status quo)
2. Create shared mock interfaces without factory methods
3. Implement comprehensive factory pattern with centralized logic

**Choice**: Implemented comprehensive factory pattern in dedicated `testutil` package.

**Rationale**: 
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for mock behavior eliminates update overhead
- **Consistency**: All tests use identical mock implementations, reducing test flakiness
- **Developer Experience**: Factory methods abstract away mock setup complexity
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new factory methods as the codebase grows

This decision establishes a pattern for future test infrastructure development and significantly improves the testing experience.

#### Repository Interface Separation

**Context**: Original architecture mixed data persistence and statistics calculation responsibilities, causing gRPC message size issues with large datasets.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Increase gRPC message size limits
2. Implement data filtering in existing APIRequestRepository
3. Create separate StatsRepository interface for statistics operations

**Choice**: Implemented dedicated StatsRepository interface with specialized implementations.

**Rationale**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each interface has a clear, focused purpose
- **Performance**: StatsRepository can optimize for aggregation operations
- **Scalability**: Separate interfaces allow independent optimization
- **Architecture**: Maintains Clean Architecture principles with proper separation of concerns

This pattern should be followed for future repository interfaces to maintain clear boundaries between different data access responsibilities.

#### Test Factory Architecture

**Context**: Need to balance comprehensive mock functionality with simplicity and performance.

**Design Choice**: Multi-tier factory architecture with base mocks, specialized wrappers, and convenience methods.

**Rationale**:
- **Base Layer**: Core mock implementations handle fundamental repository operations
- **Wrapper Layer**: Specialized mocks (instrumented, stats-focused) extend base functionality
- **Convenience Layer**: Factory methods provide easy setup for common test scenarios

This architecture allows flexibility while maintaining simplicity for common use cases.

## Impact

The factory pattern implementation represents a significant improvement in code quality and developer experience. By eliminating over 400 lines of duplicate code while adding comprehensive factory functionality, the codebase becomes more maintainable and consistent.

For developers, test setup is now standardized and simplified. Instead of defining custom mocks in each test file, developers can use factory methods that provide consistent, well-tested mock implementations. This reduces cognitive overhead and potential for test-related bugs.

The repository interface separation completes the architectural foundation for scalable statistics handling, resolving performance issues with large datasets while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

These changes establish patterns and infrastructure that will benefit future development by providing:
- Clear guidelines for test mock creation
- Consistent repository interface patterns
- Performance-optimized statistics handling
- Maintainable test infrastructure
