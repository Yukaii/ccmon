# Development Log - 2025-07-02

## What's New

#### Data Retention System
A comprehensive data retention feature has been implemented to automatically manage telemetry data lifecycle. This system provides configurable cleanup of old records, helping users maintain optimal database size while preserving necessary historical data. The feature supports intuitive duration formats like "1d", "7d", and "30d", with a safety minimum of 24 hours to prevent accidental data loss. The cleanup scheduler runs automatically every 6 hours in server mode, ensuring continuous maintenance without manual intervention.

#### Devlog Command Standardization
The devlog generation command has been significantly improved with a standardized structure and comprehensive quality controls. The new format provides clear sections for new features, fixes, and design decisions, ensuring consistent documentation across the project. This enhancement includes detailed guidelines for content creation, word count limits for readability, and integration requirements with CLAUDE.md to maintain documentation consistency.

## What's Fixed

#### FormatBlockTime Architecture Alignment
The block time formatting logic has been refactored to align with clean architecture principles. Previously residing in the domain entity layer, the `FormatBlockTime` and `formatHour` functions have been moved to the TUI helper layer where they belong. This fix resolves the architectural violation of having timezone-dependent string formatting in the domain layer, properly placing presentation concerns in the UI layer where user configuration is accessible.

## Design Decisions

#### Data Retention Implementation Pattern
**Context**: The telemetry data storage could grow indefinitely without cleanup, potentially causing performance issues and storage concerns.

**Choice**: Implemented a CQRS-compliant cleanup command pattern with configurable retention periods.

**Rationale**: The command pattern provides clear separation of concerns and testability. The configurable nature allows users to balance between data retention needs and storage constraints. The 24-hour minimum retention prevents accidental data loss while the 6-hour cleanup interval ensures timely maintenance without system overhead.

#### Presentation Logic Separation
**Context**: Time formatting functions were previously mixed within domain entities, violating clean architecture boundaries.

**Choice**: Moved all timezone-dependent formatting from entity layer to TUI helper layer.

**Rationale**: Domain entities should remain pure business logic without presentation concerns. By moving formatting to the UI layer, we maintain proper separation while keeping timezone configuration accessible where it's used. This pattern provides guidance for future presentation-related functionality placement.

#### Devlog Standardization Approach
**Context**: Development logs lacked consistent structure, making it difficult to track project evolution and decisions.

**Choice**: Created a strict template with defined sections and quality guidelines.

**Rationale**: Standardized documentation ensures historical records remain valuable for future developers. The 5-minute reading time constraint (1200-1500 words) balances comprehensiveness with practicality. The required CLAUDE.md synchronization ensures development guidance remains current with actual implementation decisions.

## Impact

These changes significantly improve the project's maintainability and operational efficiency. The data retention feature enables production deployments without storage concerns, while the architectural refactoring ensures cleaner code organization for future development. The standardized devlog format creates a valuable historical record that will help future contributors understand the evolution of design decisions and implementation choices.
