## What's New

#### Quick Query Feature Implementation
A comprehensive quick query system has been implemented, enabling users to retrieve usage statistics without launching the full TUI interface. This feature introduces the `--format` flag that supports custom format strings with predefined variables for immediate data access. Users can now query daily costs (`@daily_cost`), monthly costs (`@monthly_cost`), and plan usage percentages (`@daily_plan_usage`, `@monthly_plan_usage`) directly from the command line. The feature outputs formatted results to stdout, making it ideal for scripting, monitoring systems, and quick status checks.

#### Plan Configuration System
A new plan management system has been added with embedded JSON configuration support. The system supports Claude subscription tiers (unset, pro, max, max20) with automatic usage percentage calculations against plan limits. Plan data is embedded at compile time using Go's `go:embed` directive, eliminating runtime dependencies while enabling accurate billing calculations for different subscription tiers.

#### Service Layer Architecture Enhancement
The service layer has been formalized with the introduction of `TimePeriodFactory` for timezone-aware period calculations. This enhancement centralizes time-based logic that was previously duplicated across components, providing consistent timezone handling throughout the application. The factory pattern enables proper dependency injection while maintaining clean architecture boundaries between business logic and infrastructure concerns.

#### Comprehensive Error Handling and Resilience
Enhanced error handling has been implemented across the quick query feature with timeout management, graceful degradation, and consistent error reporting. The system now includes 15-second timeouts, context cancellation support, and standardized error outputs that ensure reliability in production environments.

## What's Fixed

#### Duplicate Period Creation Logic Elimination
Previously, period creation logic was duplicated across multiple components, leading to maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies. This has been resolved by standardizing all components to use the `TimePeriodFactory` service, eliminating 42 lines of duplicate code and three separate implementations. The refactoring ensures consistent timezone-aware calculations across the entire application.

#### Architecture Layer Violations
The `TimePeriodFactory` was initially placed in the usecase layer, violating clean architecture principles. This has been corrected by moving the implementation to the service layer while keeping the interface in the usecase layer for proper dependency inversion. This fix ensures infrastructure concerns remain separate from business logic.

#### Format Flag Documentation and Consistency
Documentation inconsistencies in the quick query feature have been resolved, with proper flag syntax (`--format` instead of `-format`) standardized across all documentation. Formatting issues in mermaid diagrams and missing newlines have been addressed to maintain code quality standards.

## Design Decisions

#### Single Query Pattern for Variable Resolution
**Context**: Initial design considered separate queries for plans, calculations, and variable generation, potentially leading to complex orchestration and performance issues.

**Choice**: Implemented a unified `GetUsageVariablesQuery` that handles all variable resolution in a single operation.

**Rationale**: This approach reduces complexity, minimizes database round-trips, and provides atomic consistency for related data. The single query pattern simplifies error handling and ensures all variables reflect the same point-in-time data, critical for accurate cost reporting.

#### Embedded Data Pattern for Plan Configuration
**Context**: Plan configuration data needed to be accessible without external dependencies while supporting easy updates and testing.

**Choice**: Used Go's `go:embed` directive with JSON files for plan data, combined with interface-based repository pattern for testability.

**Rationale**: Embedding data eliminates runtime file dependencies and deployment complexity while maintaining data integrity. The repository interface pattern preserves testability through mock implementations, and JSON format enables easy updates without code changes.

#### Outside-In Development Approach
**Context**: The quick query feature required significant new functionality across multiple architectural layers.

**Choice**: Implemented user-facing CLI interface first, then progressively built supporting infrastructure.

**Rationale**: This approach enables continuous value delivery and early validation of user requirements. Each iteration produces working functionality, reducing integration risk and enabling rapid feedback cycles. The pattern proved effective for this feature and provides guidance for future complex implementations.

#### Context-Based Timeout Strategy
**Context**: Quick queries needed to be responsive while preventing resource leaks from hanging connections.

**Choice**: Implemented 15-second timeouts with context cancellation at strategic points throughout the query pipeline.

**Rationale**: The timeout duration balances user experience with system reliability. Context propagation ensures clean resource cleanup and enables graceful degradation. Strategic cancellation points prevent partial state corruption while maintaining operation atomicity where required.

## Impact

The quick query feature significantly enhances ccmon's usability for automation and monitoring scenarios. Users can now integrate usage tracking into scripts, dashboards, and CI/CD pipelines without the overhead of the full TUI interface. The plan configuration system enables accurate cost tracking across different Claude subscription tiers, providing essential functionality for budget management.

The architectural improvements establish patterns for future feature development, particularly the service layer formalization and embedded data approach. The elimination of duplicate code and proper layer separation reduces maintenance overhead while improving system reliability.

These changes position ccmon as a more complete monitoring solution, suitable for both interactive use and programmatic integration, while maintaining the clean architecture principles that ensure long-term maintainability.
