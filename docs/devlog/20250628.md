# Development Log - June 28, 2025

## ccmon - Claude Code Monitor

### Initial Setup and TUI Implementation
- Created a TUI application using Bubble Tea to monitor Claude Code API usage
- Implemented OTLP gRPC receiver to collect telemetry data from Claude Code
- Fixed issue where token usage was showing as 0 - discovered all numeric values are sent as strings
- Refactored from CLI with log printing to full TUI with real-time updates

### Usage Tracking Enhancement
- Added separate tracking for base (Haiku) vs premium (Sonnet/Opus) models
- Base models (Haiku) don't count against Claude Code usage limits
- Implemented color-coded statistics: green for base, orange for premium
- Removed "Latest Request" section for cleaner UI

### Token Categorization
- Separated token tracking into:
  - Limited Tokens: input + output tokens that count against limits
  - Cache Tokens: cache read + creation tokens that don't count
  - Total Tokens: combined total
- Updated UI to display usage statistics in table format

### Local Data Persistence
- Added BoltDB (bbolt) for pure Go embedded database (no CGO dependencies)
- Implemented timestamp-based key storage for efficient time-range queries
- Added time filtering with keyboard shortcuts:
  - `h` - Last hour
  - `d` - Last 24 hours
  - `w` - Last 7 days
  - `m` - Last 30 days
  - `a` - All time
- Database stores up to 10,000 requests to prevent memory issues

### Monitor and Server Mode Separation
- Refactored application into two distinct modes:
  1. **Monitor Mode** (default): TUI dashboard that reads from database
     - Refreshes every 5 seconds automatically
     - Read-only, no network exposure
     - Multiple monitors can run simultaneously
  
  2. **Server Mode** (`-s`/`--server`): Headless OTLP collector
     - Logs requests to console
     - Shows periodic statistics every 30 seconds
     - Suitable for running as service/daemon

- Architecture changes:
  - Removed channel-based communication from Model
  - Model now purely reads from database
  - Clear separation between monitor and server logic
  - Created separate files: `monitor.go` and `server.go`

### Technical Details
- All numeric values from Claude Code are sent as strings and parsed with `fmt.Sscanf()`
- Using RFC3339Nano timestamp format for lexicographic key ordering
- gRPC server runs on standard OTLP port 4317
- Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive documentation

### Environment Setup
Required environment variables for Claude Code integration:
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
```

### Package Structure Refactoring
- Restructured codebase into clean package separation:
  - `receiver/` - OTLP receiver and server mode functionality
  - `monitor/` - TUI monitoring interface
  - `db/` - Shared database operations and types
  - `main.go` - Entry point with mode selection

- Benefits of new structure:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Shared types in db package reduce duplication
  - Interface-based design avoids circular dependencies
  - Easier to test and maintain individual components
  - Better follows Go project conventions

- Technical implementation:
  - Created Database interfaces in each package with only required methods
  - Moved shared types (APIRequest, TimeFilter, Filter) to db package
  - CalculateStats function moved to db package for reuse
  - Main passes database constructor functions to avoid dependencies

### Entity Package with Domain-Driven Design
- Introduced entity package to separate domain logic from infrastructure:
  - `Model`: Value type for AI model with `IsBase()` and `IsPremium()` business logic
  - `Cost`: Immutable value object for monetary amounts with `Amount()` and `Add()` methods
  - `Token`: Immutable value object with `Total()`, `Limited()`, `Cache()` calculation methods
  - `APIRequest`: Domain entity with proper encapsulation and `ID()` method
  - `Stats`: Aggregated statistics with `TotalRequests()`, `TotalTokens()`, `TotalCost()` methods

- Architectural improvements:
  - Renamed `db/types.go` to `db/schema.go` to represent database schema
  - Created mapper functions (`ToEntity`, `FromEntity`) for conversion between layers
  - Moved business logic (e.g., `isBaseModel`) from db layer to entity layer
  - Database types now purely represent persistence schema
  - Entities encapsulate all domain behavior and business rules

- Benefits of DDD approach:
  - High-level domain knowledge separated from low-level data components
  - Database schema can evolve independently from domain model
  - Business logic is testable without infrastructure dependencies
  - Immutable value objects ensure data integrity
  - Clear boundaries between layers following Clean Architecture

### Next Steps
- Consider adding export functionality for usage reports
- Potential integration with cost tracking systems
- Dashboard improvements for better data visualization
