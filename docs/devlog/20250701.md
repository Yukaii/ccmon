# Development Log - 2025-07-01

## What's New

### Version 0.4.0 Release
- **Version flag support** - Added `--version/-v` flag to display version information
- **Build metadata integration** - Version detection works with both manual and release builds
- **Release automation** - Automated release process with changelog generation

### Enhanced TUI Components
- **Focus management methods** added to OverviewTabModel for consistent behavior
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for focus management and keyboard navigation scenarios
- **Automatic table height adjustment** based on available terminal space
- **Progress bar visual improvements** - Updated progress bar colors to use a prettier gradient for better visual feedback
- **Bubble Tea progress component** - Migrated custom progress bar implementation to use official Bubble Tea component

## What's Fixed

### Daily Usage Tab Navigation Issue
- **Fixed keyboard navigation in daily usage tab** - Arrow keys (↑/↓) now work properly for scrolling through the 30-day usage data
- **Resolved height overflow in small terminals** - Headers remain visible and table content scrolls appropriately when terminal height is limited
- **Added proper focus management** - Tab switching now correctly manages focus between current and daily usage tabs

### Daily Usage Table Display Issue  
- **Fixed right border being cut off screen** - Daily usage table now properly fits within terminal boundaries
- **Root Cause**: Width calculation didn't account for Bubble Tea table component's internal spacing and borders
- **Solution**: Updated width calculation to reserve proper overhead for table formatting (24 chars total for 8 columns)

### Documentation Improvements
- **Clarified Homebrew installation** - Updated README with clearer tap addition instructions
- **Version detection** - Improved Makefile version detection using git describe

### Build Environment Updates
- **Protoc version compatibility** - Updated protoc requirement from v31.1 to v30.2 to match development environment
- **Regenerated proto files** - Protocol buffer files regenerated with protoc v30.2 for consistency

### Technical Details
- Converted daily usage table from manual string rendering to `bubbles/table` component
- Implemented proper focus/blur handling during tab switches in ViewModel
- Added height management to prevent content overflow while preserving headers
- Enhanced keyboard event routing to ensure events reach the active tab

## Design Decisions

### Version Flag Implementation
**Decision**: Integrate version information with build system using ldflags

**Rationale**:
- Provides consistent version reporting across manual and release builds
- Leverages existing GoReleaser infrastructure for clean release versions
- Git-based version detection ensures accurate development builds
- Standard CLI pattern expected by users

### Table Component Migration
**Decision**: Migrate from manual string rendering to `bubbles/table` component for daily usage display

**Rationale**: 
- Provides built-in scrolling and keyboard navigation
- Ensures consistent behavior with the requests table
- Eliminates custom scroll logic and reduces maintenance overhead
- Better handles edge cases like small terminal sizes

### Focus Management Architecture
**Decision**: Implement explicit focus management during tab switches

**Rationale**:
- Tables require focus to receive keyboard events
- Prevents confusion where keyboard input doesn't work as expected
- Provides clear ownership of input focus at any given time
- Maintains consistency with standard UI patterns

### Height Calculation Strategy
**Decision**: Use fixed header height calculation with dynamic table height

**Rationale**:
- Ensures headers are always visible regardless of content size
- Provides predictable behavior across different terminal sizes
- Balances usability (visible headers) with functionality (scrollable content)
- Prevents content from being completely hidden in small terminals

### Table Width Calculation Strategy
**Decision**: Use conservative overhead estimation for table internal formatting

**Rationale**:
- Bubble Tea table component adds its own padding/borders that weren't accounted for in original width calculations
- Conservative approach prevents border overflow across different terminal sizes
- Changed from simple column spacing to comprehensive table overhead calculation
- Added minimum width safety check to ensure usability in narrow terminals

### Progress Bar Component Migration
**Decision**: Migrate from custom progress bar to Bubble Tea progress component

**Rationale**:
- Leverages well-tested component library instead of custom implementation
- Provides consistent styling with other Bubble Tea components
- Built-in animation and gradient support
- Reduces maintenance overhead and custom rendering code
- Better handles terminal compatibility edge cases

## Impact

- **Release Management**: v0.4.0 provides stable foundation with automated changelog and version tracking
- **User Experience**: Daily usage tab now provides smooth keyboard navigation matching the current tab behavior
- **Debugging**: Version flag helps users and maintainers identify exact build information
- **Consistency**: Both tabs now share the same interaction patterns and focus management
- **Reliability**: Eliminates edge cases where navigation would fail in certain terminal configurations
- **Maintainability**: Reduced custom rendering code in favor of well-tested component library

## Documentation Enhancements

### Domain Glossary
- **Added comprehensive glossary** - Created `docs/glossary.md` defining all domain concepts, entities, and technical terms
- **Organized terminology** - Structured glossary into logical categories (Core Entities, Business Concepts, Technical Concepts, etc.)
- **Enhanced contributor onboarding** - Clear definitions help new contributors understand ccmon's domain model

### Claude Code Integration
- **Added glossary command** - Created `.claude/commands/glossary.md` for maintaining domain terminology
- **Streamlined project documentation** - Updated `CLAUDE.md` to reference glossary and removed duplicate content
- **Improved maintainability** - Centralized domain definitions in dedicated glossary file

## Refactoring Improvements

### TUI Helper Organization
- **Moved formatting functions** - Migrated `FormatBlockTime` and `formatHour` from `entity/block.go` to `handler/tui/helper.go`
- **Improved architecture compliance** - Entities now focus purely on domain logic, UI formatting moved to presentation layer
- **Enhanced testability** - Formatting functions tested in their proper architectural layer
