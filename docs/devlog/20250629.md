- **Eliminated circular dependencies** between handlers and database
- **Fixed import organization** and removed unused dependencies

### Monitor Mode Reliability

- **Type-safe data conversion** between protobuf and internal entities
- **Consistent data refresh** via gRPC queries every 5 seconds

## Design Decisions

### gRPC-First Communication Architecture
**Decision**: Replace direct database access in monitor mode with gRPC client communication

**Rationale**:
- **Eliminates database conflicts**: BoltDB single-writer limitation completely resolved
- **Enables distributed architecture**: Monitor and server can run on different machines
- **Improves scalability**: Multiple monitors can connect to single server instance
- **Protocol standardization**: Type-safe communication via Protocol Buffers
- **Future extensibility**: Easy to add new query methods and data filtering options

### Protocol Buffers Schema Design
**Decision**: Use comprehensive protobuf messages with embedded value objects

**Rationale**:
- **Type safety**: Strongly typed messages prevent serialization errors
- **Versioning support**: Protobuf provides backward compatibility for schema evolution
- **Efficient serialization**: Binary format reduces network overhead
- **Cross-language compatibility**: Future clients can be written in any language
- **Rich data modeling**: Support for complex nested structures (Stats, Token, Cost)

### Dual Service Architecture on Single Port
**Decision**: Host both OTLP receiver and Query service on same gRPC server

**Rationale**:
- **Simplified deployment**: Single port configuration reduces complexity
- **Resource efficiency**: Shared server infrastructure and connection handling
- **Service discovery**: Single endpoint for all gRPC communication
- **Operational simplicity**: Unified logging, monitoring, and lifecycle management
- **Standard compliance**: OTLP port 4317 serves as primary service endpoint

### Configuration Flexibility for Addressing
**Decision**: Separate `server.address` and `monitor.server` configuration options

**Rationale**:
- **Deployment flexibility**: Monitor can connect to remote server instances
- **Development convenience**: Local testing with different port configurations
- **Security isolation**: Monitor can connect to server through proxies or load balancers
- **Multi-environment support**: Different addressing schemes for dev/staging/prod
- **Default alignment**: Both default to localhost for seamless local development

### Build System Integration
**Decision**: Integrate protobuf generation into build pipeline with Makefile

**Rationale**:
- **Developer experience**: Single command builds entire application with dependencies
- **CI/CD compatibility**: Automated builds include protobuf compilation
- **Dependency clarity**: Explicit protoc dependency and version requirements
- **Clean separation**: Generated code clearly identified and isolated
- **Go module compatibility**: Uses go generate for standard Go toolchain integration

### Backward Compatibility Elimination
**Decision**: Remove database-based monitor mode entirely in favor of gRPC-only approach

**Rationale**:
- **Architectural clarity**: Single communication pattern reduces cognitive overhead
- **Maintenance simplicity**: One code path eliminates conditional logic and testing complexity
- **Feature consistency**: All monitors have same capabilities regardless of deployment mode
- **Future-proofing**: Architecture aligned with distributed systems best practices
- **Performance optimization**: Eliminates database polling in favor of efficient gRPC queries

### Entity-Protobuf Mapping Strategy
**Decision**: Explicit conversion functions between domain entities and protobuf messages

**Rationale**:
- **Domain integrity**: Internal entities remain independent of serialization format
- **Change isolation**: Protobuf schema changes don't affect core business logic
- **Type safety**: Compile-time verification of data transformations
- **Testing clarity**: Entity logic can be tested independently of serialization
- **API versioning**: Easy to support multiple protobuf versions with same entities

## Architecture Impact

The gRPC query service implementation represents a fundamental shift from database-centric to service-oriented architecture. This change eliminates the core limitation of BoltDB's single-writer constraint while introducing powerful distributed system capabilities. The monitor mode now operates as a true client application, communicating with a centralized server through a well-defined API contract.

This architectural evolution enables horizontal scaling of monitoring interfaces, supports deployment across multiple machines, and provides a foundation for future enhancements such as real-time streaming updates, advanced filtering, and multi-tenant access patterns. The Protocol Buffers interface ensures long-term compatibility and enables development of additional client applications in any programming language.

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility for server mode functionality while completely modernizing the monitor mode architecture. All existing OTLP telemetry collection continues to work unchanged, with the added benefit of concurrent query access through the new gRPC service.
